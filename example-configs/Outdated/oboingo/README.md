Description
-----

Plenty of hackish things stolen from other configs.
Uses multiple screens based off the hostname of the computer
it is running on.  Sets up groups/bars/etc based off screen count.

Uses numbered groups.
Assigns groups to particular screens via a static list.
Sets up keys to move programs to different groups.

Use key chords / key chains / key nodes to allow groups of keys.

Programs autostarted on certain screen/groups.

Has a rough time logger portion that logs every window/screen change in qtile,
so that analysis can be run on it to see where you spend (or waste) your time.
