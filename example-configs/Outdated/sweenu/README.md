## Sweenu's qtile config
A simple config setup, broken up in several files

### Screenshots
- `Ctrl + PrintScreen` opens up deepin-screenshot which lets you choose either
some part of the screen, a specific window or the whole screen
- `PrintScreen` saves the screenshot under ~/Pictures/screenshot_$(date +%s) and
copies it to the clipboard

### Backlight
On a scale of 100, the backlight goes up 10 by 10 from 40 but 1 by 1 under in
order to have more precision for how dark the screen should be.

### Music
`mod + m` goes directly to the "Music" group and opens up Spotify
