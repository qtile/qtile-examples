These are originallly based on tych0's config example.

Some new things:

1) A dynamic mail group based on starting mutt.
2) Cpu, upload, and download graphs.
3) a group to monitor the behavior of a transparent socks proxy I run sometimes.
   This one is started from a separate python script run after the window manager
   has started (see proxy.py in this directory).
4) Terminals are urxvt with Anonymous Pro font.
