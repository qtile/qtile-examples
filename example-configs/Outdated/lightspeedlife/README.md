# read me #

I wanted a window manager that would take my windows, put them in little boxes,
move the boxes around just the way I wanted, and look pretty all the while
doing it. I thought, "hey, I know a little python. And python's easy, right? I
can do this." So this ad-hoc mess of code spaghetti is my attempt to create a window manager that satisfies me while I learn a little python.
