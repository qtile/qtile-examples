Features include:
 caps lock-based
 special layouts for gimp and pidgin
 jailing of certain apps to dynamically created groups
 alternate urgent hint notification
 alternate default floating rules

This keyboard layout uses caps lock instead of the windows (or some other key)
as your main control key. This approach has several advantages:
  * mod3 is (typically, in most distros) an unbound modifier key, so you can do
    this without changing any other behavior (unlike coopting some other mod
    keys)
  * you no longer accidentally activate caps lock
  * caps lock is unused by everything (even windows VMs), so you don't have any
    key conflicts with apps
  * it is (arguably) easier to hit than the windows key
  * you can finally make use of that stupid key

Of course, it also has several disadvantages:
  * configuration is keyboard interface dependent and can be nontrivial
  * some OS upgrades bork your Lock => mod3 binding, rendering your WM unusable

You can work around the second problem by binding some "panic sequence" of keys
(for me, logout) to something that doesn't depend on mod3 being mapped
correctly. Then, before you do an upgrade that looks like it might break
something, be at a good stopping point and ready to "panic" :-)

The first problem is also workable as long as you know what you're doing. If
you're lucky, xmodmap will work for you, and you can just add the line:
  xmodmap ~/.qtile/xmodmaprc
to your ~/.xsession (the xmodmaprc is included in this directory).

However, if you're not so lucky, you may have to resort to compiling your own
keyboard layout (I have to do this). I'm not sure exactly when each situation
applies, but I think for sure you'll have to do this if you're using a PS/2
keyboard (I've also had to do it for various USB keyboards). To do this, you'll
want to add:
  QTILE=/home/tycho/.qtile
  xkbcomp -I$QTILE/xkb $QTILE/xkb/keymap/tycho $DISPLAY
to your ~/.xsession. You'll also need to copy the entire contents (including
the directory structure) of the ./xkb directory to $QTILE.

That's all there is to it!
